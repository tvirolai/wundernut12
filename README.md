# wundernut12

A solution for the [Wundernut puzzle vol 12](https://github.com/wunderdogsw/wundernut-vol12).

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
- You also need an API key for [OCR Space's Free OCR API](https://ocr.space/OCRAPI)

## Usage

- Set the API key to an environment variable `API_KEY`:

``` shell
EXPORT API_KEY=myapikey
```

- Run the application:

``` shell
lein run
```

If the API key is missing, the application will fall back to using pre-OCR'd text under the `resources` folder. The black and white version of the input image will also be created there.
